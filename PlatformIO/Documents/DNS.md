Domain Name System
<p>phonebook of the Internet
<p>domain names(google.com), DNS is responsible finding correct IP address 
<p>Browsers use those addresses to communicate with origin servers or CDN edge servers to access website information
<p>server: device or program provids services to other programs(clients)
<p> DNS clients (built into most modern desktop and mobile operating systems) enable web browsers to interact with DNS servers
<p>typical DNS query: four servers, work together,deliver an IP address to the client: recursive resolvers, root nameservers, TLD nameservers, and authoritative nameservers.
<p>DNS recursor (= DNS resolver) a server receives the query from the DNS client, interacts with other DNS servers to hunt down the correct IP
<p>resolver receives request from client-> behaves as a client, querying the other three types of DNS servers in search of the right IP
